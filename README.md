# TriFC (triangle-based formwork calculation on IFC files)

This project is a master's thesis done on the faculty of structural engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). 

This library consists of four classes for calculating and visualizing formwork from concrete models in IFC files. Inside the TriFC folder, the full library with all functions is available. All functions are commented on. If you only want to try the model, examples of use are shown in the example_of_use.py and example_of_use.ipynb. It is two example files in the library that the examples are run on, but it is possible to change them with your own IFC files and try the model on them. The model returns a CSV and an updated IFC from every run.

For more details on how to use the model, functions, ideas, and explanation of the full model please see the thesis.
