# TriFC (triangle based formwork caclulation on IFC files)

This project is a master thesis done on the faculty of structual design at the Norwegian univeristy of science and technology (NTNU). 

This library consists of four classes for calculating and visualizing formwork from concrete models in IFC files. Inside the TriFC folder the full library with all functions are avaible. All functions are commented. If you only want to try the model, example of use are shown in the example_of_use.py and example_of_use.ipynb. It is two example files in the library that the examples are runned on, but it is possible to change them with your own IFC files and try the model on them. The model returns a CSV and a updated IFC from every run.

For more details on how to use the model, functions, ideas and explenation of the full model pleace see the thesis. Link here.
